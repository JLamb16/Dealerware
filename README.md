## Database Design

![ERD](img/DWDB.png)

I have proceeded to create a simplistic database design following the snowflake schema methodology. In doing so we can utilize less disk space because data is normalized and there is minimal data redundancy. This will help provide protection from data integrity issues. Maintenance is simple due to a smaller risk of data integrity violations and low level of data redundancy.
